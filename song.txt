Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now, you should've somehow
Realised what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now

Backbeat, the word is on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody
